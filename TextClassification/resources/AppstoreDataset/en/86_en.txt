Post whatever you want to your Tumblr. Follow other people who are doing the same. You’ll probably never be bored again.

• Post anything: Photos, GIFs, videos, quotes, chats, links, text—like we said, pretty much whatever.
• Make one blog or tons of blogs. Whatever ideas you have, Tumblr is your place to put them. 
• Customize those blogs to look as beautiful or as weird as you want. 
• Interact with other people on Tumblr by reblogging their posts. Experience the thrill of seeing your own posts reblogged by other people. 
• Send fan mail, asks, and submissions to the blogs you love. 
• Have fun. Finally.
