Not a suggestion. Not a pro-tip. TRY HARDER is a mandate. Sprint headlong into certain death and put your mobile reflexes to the test. Run longer. Jump higher. Try harder. If none of those work: TRY HARDER.

-Run, jump and glide through a horrible gauntlet of aesthetically pleasing death traps.
-Add to your trail of corpses with every failure, then trample them to victory!
-Grab power-ups to avoid traps and last a few more precious seconds.
-Check your score on the leaderboards and unlock hidden achievements.
